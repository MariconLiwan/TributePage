    <h3 id="headline">TIMELINE OF MACLI-ING'S LIFE</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - There are no records documenting Macli-ing Dulag's date of birth, but he was born in the highland village of Bugnay, Tinglayan, Kalinga-Apayao. Hence, his indicated birth year is only estimated.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1960s</strong> - Macli-ing became a respected pangat (leader) among the Butbut people,[5] who lived in the villages of Bugnay, Buscalan, Lokong, Ngibat and Butbut in the Municipality of Tinglayan, Kalinga.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1974</strong> - As a pangat of the Butbut, Macli-ing was one of the first leaders to oppose the project, organizing a bodong (peace council) in Barrio Tanglag in 1974 as an attempt to rally opposition against the Chico dam.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1977</strong> - Macli-ing was incarcerated alongside 16 Bugnay villagers by the Philippine Constabulary (PC) Brigade. they were accused of supposed subversion and of obstructing government projects, and various other offenses such as boycotting the October 1976 Constitutional Referendum. Later that year, they were released with the pressure of Amnesty International.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1979</strong> - The December 1979 bodong was attended by 2,000 Kalingas and Bontocs and saw Macli-ing officially designated as the official spokesperson for the opposition effort.
      </li>
    
        
      <h2>The Assasination of Macli-ing Dulag</h2>
      
      <li>
        <strong>1980</strong> - Macli-ing Dulag was assassinated by Marcos-controlled military forces on April 24, 1980.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Eyewitness accounts indicate that ten individuals in military uniforms arrived in Bugnay on two Ford Fiera trucks, seeking out Macli-ing Dulag and Pedro Dungoc Sr., another opposition leader who lived nearby.

The military personnel told Macli-ing to come out, but he refused, telling them to return the following day. He asked his wife to hold the door closed while he secured its lock, and lit a lamp to do so. The light of the lamp allowed the assailants to see where their target was behind the door, and they immediately fired on Macli-ing through a slit under the door, killing him instantly. He sustained a total of ten bullet wounds, with the fatal ones being on the left breast and the right pelvis. At least 13 bullet holes were later found on the door and walls of Macli-ing Dulag's residence, and shell casings from a Browning Automatic Rifle and an M-16 rifle were found.

Dungoc Sr., upon hearing the commotion, immediately arranged his pillows and blanket to make it seem like a person was asleep inside and hid beside it. When men in uniform began shouting in their direction, demanding for them to open the door, his wife answered the door. She pointed to the soldiers where his husband was "sleeping," and the soldiers opened fire upon the rolled-up blanket. Dungoc Sr. managed to escape with only a minor hit on the wrist.

        You ask if we own the land and mock as saying, 'Where is your title?, When we ask the meaning of your words you answer with taunting arrogance, 'Where are the documents to prove that you own the land?' Titles? Documents? Proof of ownership. Such arrogance to speak of owning the land when we instead are woned by it. How can you own that which will outlive you.? Only the race owns the land because the race lives forever.
